# Fake-News-Detection-System
## Project Introduction
This is an initiative to identify fake news. Due to its destructive potential to cause significant social and national harm, widespread false news on social media and other media outlets is of grave concern. The system for detecting fake news has been developed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and MaxEnt Classifiers.

The project is designed following a project management plan (PMP) to organize the project's lifecycle more effectively. As a result of the project management plan, we can deliver solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner, save money and increase client satisfaction. 

Generally, a project management plan consists of five phases: Project Initiating, Project Planning, Project Executing, Project Monitoring and Controlling, and Project Closing.
