# Fake News Detection System
## Project Introduction
This is an initiative to identify fake news. Due to its destructive potential to cause significant social and national harm, widespread false news on social media and other media outlets is of grave concern. The system for detecting fake news has been developed using Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, including Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and MaxEnt Classifiers.

The project is designed following a Project Management Plan (PMP) to organize the project's lifecycle more effectively. As a result of the Project Management Plan, we can deliver solutions in a timely and cost-effective manner, save money and increase client satisfaction. 

Generally, a Project Management Plan consists of five phases: 
- Project Initiating
- Project Planning
- Project Executing
- Project Monitoring and Controlling
- Project Closing 

## Project Management Plan (PMP)
### Project Overview
The [Project Overview](https://github.com/FilleHeureuse/Fake-News-Detection-System/blob/main/Project%20Management%20Plan%20(PMP)/I.%20Project%20Overview.md) provides an outline of the project's objectives and team members.

### Project Initiating
The project starts with the [Project Initiation](https://github.com/FilleHeureuse/Fake-News-Detection-System/blob/main/Project%20Management%20Plan%20(PMP)/II.%20Project%20Initiating.md). The objective of project initiation is to define the project broadly. Typically, the project charter and stakeholders are incorporated into this process.

### Project Planning
[Project Planning](https://github.com/FilleHeureuse/Fake-News-Detection-System/blob/main/Project%20Management%20Plan%20(PMP)/III.%20Project%20Planning.md) phase is essential to effective project management and focuses on creating a road map for the team. The project's scope is specified, and a plan for project management is developed. Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Gantt Chart, and Scope Statement (PMP) are included in the Project Management Plan.

### Project Executing
[Project Execution](https://github.com/FilleHeureuse/Fake-News-Detection-System/blob/main/Project%20Management%20Plan%20(PMP)/III.%20Project%20Executing.md) is the phase in which the work is completed and the project objectives are met. The result, coding blocks, and technical implementation are defined and documented.

### Project Monitoring and Controlling
The objective of [Project Monitoring and Controlling](https://github.com/FilleHeureuse/Fake-News-Detection-System/blob/main/Project%20Management%20Plan%20(PMP)/III.%20Project%20Executing.md) is to measure and evaluate project progress and performance in order to manage variation and change.

### Project Closing
[Project Closing](https://github.com/FilleHeureuse/Fake-News-Detection-System/blob/main/Project%20Management%20Plan%20(PMP)/III.%20Project%20Closing.md) phase is undertaken to complete all activities and formally finish the project or phase with a closing document and a report on lessons learned.
