# PROJECT INITIATING
Several tasks were stated in the initiation procedure: defining the project's goal, preparing the project charter, identifying the project's stakeholders, appointing the project team, and holding a kick-off meeting.

#### 1. Project Goal

#### 3. Project Charter
In the initiation phase, the project charter is the most significant deliverable. The project charter plays a crucial role in the project's development since it is the first formal definition of the project. Project charters establish the project manager's legal authority, define the project's high-level requirements, milestones, and success criteria for the project, as well as the project manager's authority to take on the project.
&nbsp;<br>
The project charter must contain the following:
&nbsp;<br>
-Problem definition
-	Project description (high-level overview of the work)
-	Project objectives (what is the project's purpose)
-	Objectives and outcomes
-	scope (overview of what's in, out, or uncertain)
-	Stakeholder roles, responsibilities, and involvement
-	Major deliverables
-	High-level milestones
-	Time frames 
-	Funding authority
-	Identification of the project team
-	Assumption
#### 5. Kick-off Meeting
The primary purpose of a kick-off meeting is to ensure that everyone is on the same page and off to a strong start. To get work started as quickly as possible, this is a chance to introduce people to the team and provide more information about the project.
