# Project Planning
### Kick-off Meeting
The primary purpose of a kick-off meeting is to ensure that everyone is on the same page and off to a strong start. To get work started as quickly as possible, this is a chance to introduce people to the team and provide more information about the project.

### Project Management Life Cycle
In order to adhere to the guidelines and achieve milestones on a regular basis, the project management life cycle is outlined and documented in Gantt charts. Each member's tasks and work are broken down into several modules by the project life cycle (WBS). The WBS outlines the individual roles and responsibilities of each member during each stage of the lifecycle.

### Scope
Establishing the boundaries of a project's purview is of the utmost significance. As a result, in this project, to detect fake news, this system will only recognise the news, not the story or the chat. For instance, the system will display an error warning if a user enters stories or conversations into the text field.
